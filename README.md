## Portfolio Info

[Portfolio Website](https://jacklcmore.github.io/portfolio/)

As a budding full-stack web dev it is my goal through this portfolio not only to showcase my current, past and upcoming projects but to improve as well! As time goes by I intend to use this very portfolio as an ongoing log of my progress, each iteration of the portfolio improving from the last.
